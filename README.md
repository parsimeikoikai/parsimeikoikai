My role often extends beyond development into leadership and project management, where I coordinate cross-functional teams, manage timelines, and ensure successful project delivery.

Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Digital Transformation to deepen my understanding of how technology shapes organizational change, I am well-equipped to bridge the gap between technical implementation and strategic goals. My academic background in Mathematics and Computer Science provides me with strong analytical skills, which I apply to tackle complex challenges and drive innovation.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working alongside cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions. My leadership and project management abilities allow me to guide teams effectively, tackle complex challenges, and bring projects to successful completion.
